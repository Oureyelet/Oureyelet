### Hello Everyone !  ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mateusz, I am self-taught c++ programmer (without computer science degree or collague degree but !) I have a passion 
and motivation to learn new programming skills every single day. I learn c++ from www.learncpp.com. Each day I try to spend 
one hour at least for improve my qualifications/knowledge and hopefully to change my currently job one day.

- My target: Be a C++ full-time programmer :)  



- âš¡ Motivation: Date of started learn c++: 23 february 2021
-    Spent time on learning:                   May(2021): 14,5 Hours

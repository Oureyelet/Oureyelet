I am detail-oriented, talented in following rules and instructions, and known for remaining calm, peaceful, and respectful under pressure. I am passionate about protecting people and aligning with organizational goals, with a strong focus on ethical behaviour. My interest in cybersecurity lies in preventing unauthorized access to restricted systems, detecting suspicious activity, and swiftly responding to potential threats. I place a high value on ensuring compliance with security regulations and internal protocols, maintaining a calm and effective workflow during crisis situations, and advocating for user-friendly security measures that protect all users, especially those with less technical expertise.

- :guitar: Playing the guitar has been my hobby since remember.

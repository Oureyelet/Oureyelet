### Hello Everyone !  ðŸ‘‹

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateusz-adam-kacperski-070847201/

I am passion self-taught C++ programmer (without computer science degree or collague degree but !) I have a no-limit energy 
and motivation to learn new programming skills every single day. I learn C++ from places like www.learncpp.com or book C++ Primer Plus (Developer's Library) by Stephen Prata. Each day I try to spend one hour at least for improve my qualifications/knowledge and hopefully to change my currently job one day.

- :bust_in_silhouette: Iâ€™m currently work as a full-time Team Leader.
- :guitar: Playing the guitar has been my hobby since remember.
- :footprints: I hope one day my little baby girl (Sophie) will be interested to programing like me :)


- My target: Be a C++ full-time programmer :)

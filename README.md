I am passion self-taught C++ Developer (without computer science degree or collague degree but !) I have a no-limit energy 
and motivation to learn new programming skills every single day. I learn C++ from places like [www.learncpp.com](http://www.learncpp.com/) 
or book [C++ Primer Plus 6th Edition 2011](https://zhjwpku.com/assets/pdf/books/C++.Primer.Plus.6th.Edition.Oct.2011.pdf). Each day I try to spend one hour at least for improve my qualifications/knowledge and hopefully to change my currently job one day.

- :bust_in_silhouette: Iâ€™m currently work as a full-time Team Leader in manufacturing industrie.
- :guitar: Playing the guitar has been my hobby since remember.
- :footprints: I hope one day my little baby girl (Sophie) will be interested to programing like me :)
- My target: Be a C++ full-time Software Developer :)

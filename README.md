Back in 2016, I landed in the UK without knowing much English. The first I made it to learn the language. After that, I picked up a new skill â€“ welding and fabrication. My hard work paid off with two promotions in the next two years. First, I became a Team Leader Buddy, filling in when the leader was away. Then, I got a full-time Team Leader role, where I led and supported my team. Along the way, I joined various training programs. I learned about Lean Leadership, Mental Wellbeing, Managing Safely, and 8D Problem-solving. In 2022, I got another promotion. Now, I'm a Trainee Section Manager, handling IT support and data projects. It feels great to be trusted with more responsibilities. From struggling with English to managing teams and projects, it's been a journey. I'm proud of how far I've come and excited about what's next.

- :bust_in_silhouette: Iâ€™m currently work as a full-time Trainee Section Manager in manufacturing industrie.
- :guitar: Playing the guitar has been my hobby since remember.
- :footprints: I hope one day my little baby girl (Sophie) will be interested to IT like me :)
- My target: Ultimately, my goal is to become a full-stack software developer, equipped with a deep understanding of front-end, back-end and databases :)
